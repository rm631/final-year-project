# Final Year Project - Notecast

## Introduction

The purpose of the final year project was to gain an in depth understanding of particular technical topics (eg. programming language, software development tool, etc.) which were not taught as part of the rest of the degree. I undertook making a web-based real time collaborative space for students to watch lectures and take notes. The project gave me the opportunity to use node.js for the first time, as well as developing my existing related skills such as databases and web development.

Database connections (which are in half a dozen files - at some point I will clean this all up a bit) and an API key has been removed from line 274 in index.php.
